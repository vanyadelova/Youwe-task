## What this project is about
This is my own attempt at the Global Gaming's Frontend challenge. I was expected to develop a well-structured movie library application (such as Netflix and Amazon) using any design I want. The app should at minimum support the following primary functions:
- **List a number of movies**
- **Search for a movie by title**
- **Filter movies by different genres**
- **Navigate to a specific movie as to preview further details**
- **Should be interactive to numerous resolutions**

It is a SPA(Single Page Application) app made with [React](https://reactjs.org/). It is built on top of [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/) and it is fully responsive.

## Run it locally ðŸ–¥
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/vanyadelova/Youwe-task.git
$ npm install # to install node packages.
$ npm start # to run the app.
```
Then open `localhost:3000` on browser to see the app.
