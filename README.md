## What this project is about
This is my own attempt at the Youwe's Frontend challenge. I was expected to develop a well-structured social intranet page using the supplied designs.. The app should at minimum support the following primary functions:
- **The contact form must be validated, the form may not be sent before all fields have been filled in correctly.**
- **Clicking on the head of a closed block causes the block to open and the text below will become visible. Folding the block open must animate.**
- **Animation**
- **Navigate to a specific movie as to preview further details**
- **Should be interactive to numerous resolutions**

It is a SPA(Single Page Application) app made with [React](https://reactjs.org/). It is built on top of [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/) and it is fully responsive.

## Run it locally ðŸ–¥
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/vanyadelova/Youwe-task.git
$ npm install # to install node packages.
$ npm start # to run the app.
```
Then open `localhost:3000` on browser to see the app.
